An assignment I completed in college, spring 2018. The goal was to create an Android application in the form of a playable video game, with a focus on showcasing the elements of UI control that we'd learned so far. All assets were created by me, with the exception of music from https://www.bensound.com/ and the painting “The Triumph of the Guillotine in Hell” by Nicolas Antoine Taunay.
