# Gladius
This program can be run by sideloading Gladius.apk to an Android device.

Gladius is in the form of a side-scroller, with three levels. In each, the player must traverse a distance while blocking arrows with their shield. The shield has limited durability, and in all levels after the first, the player must best an enemy swordsman before they can proceed.

I completed this project in spring 2018. All assets were created by me, with the exception of music from https://www.bensound.com/ and the painting “The Triumph of the Guillotine in Hell” by Nicolas Antoine Taunay.
