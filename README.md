# Gladius
This program can be run by sideloading Gladius.apk to an Android device.

Resources.zip contains all the images, music, and sounds used in the making of Gladius. Original images (with layers) for editing are in .pdn format, which is used by [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/). Finalized images are in .png. Music files are in .mp3 format, and sound effects are in .3gp.

Gladius is in the form of a side-scroller, with three levels. In each, the player must traverse a distance while blocking arrows with their shield. The shield has limited durability, and in all levels after the first, the player must best an enemy swordsman before they can proceed.

I completed this project in spring 2018. All assets were created by me, with the exception of music from https://www.bensound.com/ and the painting “The Triumph of the Guillotine in Hell” by Nicolas Antoine Taunay.
